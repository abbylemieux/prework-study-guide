# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This is a prework study guide. It contains a large amount of the fundementals you will need in the coding bootcamp, as well as in your coding career. I built this project as a quick refrence guide to help me throught the bootcamp. It solves the need to try and find all the details in the furture. This refrence should quickly help me come up with resolutions. In making this guide I learned how to use HTML and CSS. As well as a refresher in JavaScript.
